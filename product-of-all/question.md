##1 Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

##2 For example, given:

##2  [1, 7, 3, 4]

##2 your function would return:

##2  [84, 12, 28, 21]

##2 by calculating:

##2  [7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]

##1 Do not use division in your solution.
